1. Introduction
----------------

Areen is a Legal Neutral human wild mage NPC. He is very serious about wild magic and mental discipline.

The mod includes a few objects useful to Areen (some exclusive, some don't) and a revised version of the Wild Surge table.

Areen is fully romanceable and comes with a (non-mandatory) small quest.

3. General Information
-----------------------

This mod adds Areen as a viable, fully developed NPC.

Areen can be found in the Waukeen's Promenade of Athkatla, standing next to the blast area. You do not need to start a new game to get him into your party. In ToB, he can also be summoned from the Pocket Plane Fate Spirit.

He has a full friendship with the PC, banters with Bioware and Beamdog NPCs, a number of interjections, character reactions and other scenery dialogue, both in SoA and ToB. He has an optional short quest.

Areen and NPCs of his quest have custom, AI-developed portraits.

Female human, elven, and half-elven protagonists may begin a romance with Areen and continue it to ToB. 

Depending on PC's level, Areen's experience may be 161000, 400000, 800000 or 1200000 experience points. In ToB, Areen starts with 2500000 experience.
