// A script to "fix" Branwen's name and soundset, if it suddenly goes wrong. This is what happens when you select Branwen and press K(the script block about pressing K is in Branwen/Scripts/O#BranS.baf).
// This is going to be boring, but you got to take all your soundset lines from your Setup-MyMod.tp2 and copy them here like I just did.

// There is another way, if you want it. It's called traification. Download Coran NPC from http://www.pocketplane.net/coran and check his O#CoranF.baf and Setup-Coran.tra. You'll have to add LANGUAGE lines to your Setup-MyMod.tp2.
// TRA tutorials are available in Weidu's README, as well.
