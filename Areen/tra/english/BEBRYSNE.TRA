@4000 = ~Good day, M'<PRO_LADYLORD>. How may I help you?~
@4001 = ~We are looking for a medallion that belonged to lord Thayze Selemchant, which was donated to the temple some years ago, do you still have it?~
@4002 = ~We would like to purchase the medallion of the late Thayze Selemchant. I've been informed it was donated to the temple.~
@4003 = ~I know which medallion you are describing. And I can see a Selemchant travels with you. *bows gently* But I am afraid I cannot just hand it to you, if you know what I mean.~
@4004 = ~What is that you want then?~
@4005 = ~Perhaps a bargain? We are in Waukeen's house after all.~
@4006 = ~I would gladly trade you the medallion for an amulet of protection. I am afraid there is nothing else I can do for you on this matter. Now, if you excuse me, I have chores to do. Waukeen be with you.~
@4007 = ~I knew you would come and I see you bring the amulet, excellent. Here is the medallion. Go now with Waukeen's blessings.~
