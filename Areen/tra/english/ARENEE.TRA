// Dorn SoA

@0    = ~I've been watching you, mage. You flinch whenever I pass, like prey sensing a predator.~
@1    = ~I assure you, Il-Khan, it's not fear that prompts my reaction but rather a scholarly aversion to the miasma of otherworldly energy that clings to you. Most... unhygienic.~
@2    = ~Pretty words to mask simple fear.~
@3    = ~There's nothing simple about a rational response to danger, sir. In Athkatla, we learn to distinguish between power and mere brutality. The Council of Six doesn't maintain control through mindless violence, but through calculated application of influence.~
@4    = ~The Council of Six? Merchants hiding behind wealth and whispers. My patron grants me strength that would crush your precious Council in an instant.~
@5    = ~Yes, and at what cost? I've studied enough planar theory to recognize a ruinous bargain. Your patron collects far more than he gives, blackguard. That's not power—it's a rather obvious confidence scheme with your soul as collateral.~

@6    = ~I couldn't help but notice your technique during our last encounter, Dorn. Your sword strokes appear chaotic, but there's a discernible pattern to your movements.~
@7    = ~Analyzing my fighting style, mage? Planning to run more efficiently when the time comes?~
@8    = ~Hardly. I'm merely noting that your combat approach mirrors certain chaotic energy patterns in wild magic. Fascinating, really...primitive, but effective.~
@9    = ~In battle, the only theory that matters is who remains standing. Your Amnian academics would soil themselves facing what I've conquered.~
@10   = ~You underestimate Amn, sir. But I suppose subtlety isn't valued in... where was it again? Luskan?~
@11   = ~Mock my origins at your peril, mage. Unlike you, I've shed the weakness of my past. When this journey ends, remember who you taunted while hiding behind <CHARNAME>'s protection.~

@12   = ~Selemchant. I've come to a conclusion about you.~
@13   = ~Have you indeed? I await your scholarly assessment with bated breath.~
@14   = ~You hide behind words, but beneath it all, you're driven by the same hunger for power that drives me.~
@15   = ~There is a rather significant difference between methodical study of the arcane and selling one's soul to the first demonic entity that offers a shortcut to power, Il-Khan.~
@16   = ~Is there? Your wild magic courts chaos itself. You open yourself to forces beyond your control, just as I have. The only difference is that I acknowledge my pact, while you disguise yours with academic pretension.~

// Dorn ToB

@17   = ~We walk among gods and divine power, surrounded by the essence of a dead deity. Does your academic mind comprehend what we face, mage?~
@18   = ~Actually, this presents quite the unprecedented research opportunity. The metaphysical implications of fractured godhood are... well, they're rather beyond what even the most advanced thaumaturgical texts could anticipate.~
@19   = ~Research? We stand in the shadow of divinity itself, and you treat it like some classroom exercise.~
@20   = ~On the contrary. Unlike some who merely seek to harness power without understanding it, I recognize the fundamental importance of comprehending what we're dealing with. One doesn't simply stumble blindly into godhood.~
@21   = ~Your precious understanding won't shield you when the children of Bhaal come for blood. My blade will do more than your theories.~
@22   = ~Fascinating how you consistently reduce everything to violence. Has it occurred to you that <CHARNAME>'s divine heritage represents more than just another opportunity for bloodshed?~
@23   = ~When this is finished, <CHARNAME> will ascend or die. The weak theorists like you will record the tale for others to read, while those with true strength shape reality itself.~
@24   = ~Do not mistake caution for weakness, blackguard. I've spent my life mastering forces that would shatter your mind. Should <CHARNAME> choose divinity, I intend to understand it fully, not merely applaud from below like some sycophantic acolyte. Knowledge is power—a concept evidently too subtle for your patron to have explained.~

// Hexxat SoA

@25   = ~You keep a careful distance from me, mage. Yet I sense your eyes studying me when you believe I'm unaware.~
@26   = ~A professional curiosity, nothing more. Most scholars lack the... opportunity for direct observation.~
@27   = ~And should I offer you a closer examination, would your curiosity overcome your obvious discomfort? Many find the prospect... irresistible.~
@28   = ~I appreciate the offer, but I prefer to maintain certain professional boundaries in my research. One doesn't study a fire elemental by leaping into the flames, after all. I'm quite content observing from a scholarly and prudent distance.~

// Hexxat ToB

@29   = ~When all this is finished, where will you go, Selemchant? Back to your studies in Amn?~
@30   = ~Assuming we survive this business with Bhaal's essence? I suppose I shall return to my research. Though after witnessing the metaphysical principles at work here, my previous studies seem rather... elementary in comparison.~
@31   = ~Immortality offers endless time for study. Should you ever reconsider those... professional boundaries of yours, I could show you secrets no mortal academy has catalogued.~

// Neera SoA

@32   = ~Must you always gesture so wildly when casting? You're like a windmill in a hurricane.~
@33   = ~Not all of us treat magic like a stuffy lecture. Some of us actually enjoy it!~
@34   = ~One can maintain dignity without sacrificing efficacy. Your approach is rather like using a battering ram to open an unlocked door.~
@35   = ~Well, my "battering ram" gets results! When's the last time your "dignified" magic did anything unexpected?~
@36   = ~Unexpected? Wild magic is inherently unexpected. The difference is that I study the patterns within chaos. You simply... flail.~
@37   = ~Flail? I improvise! That's the whole point of wild magic!~
@38   = ~Improvisation requires understanding fundamentals. You're like someone who's never seen a lute attempting to compose a symphony.~
@39   = ~Ugh! You're impossible! Not everyone had fancy Amnian tutors and dusty tomes!~
@40   = ~A shame, really. You might have learned that talent without discipline is merely unrealized potential.~
@41   = ~"Talent without discipline is merely unrealized potential." Do you practice these little speeches?~
@42   = ~I don't need to practice stating the obvious. Though I understand why you might find it challenging.~
@43   = ~You know what, Areen? You're right. I should be more disciplined. I'll start by restraining myself from turning you into a squirrel.~
@44   = ~How original. Transmutation threats—the last refuge of the magically ineloquent.~

@45   = ~So... Areen. Ever accidentally turned anyone into a chicken? I've done it three times!~
@46   = ~How fascinating. I've never considered poultry transformation a benchmark for magical achievement.~
@47   = ~Oh come on! You can't tell me you've never had a single funny magical mishap!~
@48   = ~The difference between us, Neera, is that I don't consider potentially lethal arcane incidents to be "funny."~
@49   = ~You're about as much fun as a textbook on Amnian tax law. You know that?~
@50   = ~Having read several such volumes, I assure you they're far more intellectually stimulating than watching you hurl random effects about like a child with fireworks.~
@51   = ~At least fireworks bring joy to people's lives...~

@52   = ~Neera, I've been meaning to comment on your... activities with your fellow wild mages.~
@53   = ~What about it? Going to lecture me on proper wild magic etiquette again?~
@54   = ~Actually, I was going to say that your efforts against the Red Wizards are... not entirely without merit.~
@55   = ~Wait... was that almost... a compliment? Are you feeling alright?~
@56   = ~Quite. While your methods remain haphazard at best, your dedication to protecting practitioners of our art shows a certain... commendable quality.~
@57   = ~I'm sorry, did you just say "our art"? As in, you and me, same team?~
@58   = ~The distinction between your approach and mine remains vast, but the fundamental principles are... related. In a technical sense.~
@59   = ~So basically, you approve of what I'm doing, just not how I'm doing it?~
@60   = ~A crude but not entirely inaccurate summation. Your sanctuary project could have used a more rigorous magical theory and less... improvisational enthusiasm.~
@61   = ~I'll, uh, thanks? Look at that... I think someone's calling me over there!~

// Neera ToB

@62   = ~Neera, I've observed a marked improvement in your casting technique. Almost... methodical at times.~
@63   = ~Was that an actual compliment? From you?~
@64   = ~Merely an empirical observation. Your wild surges appear less... well, wild.~
@65   = ~Maybe I've picked up a thing or two. Even from you, believe it or not.~
@66   = ~Indeed? Perhaps there's hope for structured magical education after all.~
@67   = ~Don't get too excited. But watching <CHARNAME> deal with this whole... divine heritage thing made me realize some power needs control.~
@68   = ~A profound insight. <CHARNAME>'s situation rather puts our magical quibbles in perspective, doesn't it?~
@69   = ~Exactly!~
@70   = ~Well, I... good heavens. You and I finding common ground. Who would have, um... imagined?~

// Rasaad

@71   = ~Your meditation techniques are rather... fascinating, Rasaad. The control you exhibit is quite remarkable.~
@72   = ~Thank you. The path of Selûne teaches that discipline of the body leads to clarity of the mind.~
@73   = ~Control is essential when dealing with volatile energies.~
@74   = ~Indeed. I have observed your careful approach to wild magic. It reminds me of how we learn to channel inner light.~
@75   = ~I hadn't considered the parallel. My parents taught that wild magic requires rigorous study precisely because of its unpredictable nature.~
@76   = ~Sometimes the most chaotic forces require the steadiest hands to guide them.~
@77   = ~That's... quite insightful. Perhaps there's more common ground between our disciplines than I initially presumed.~

@78   = ~Rasaad, I've been attempting to incorporate some of your breathing techniques into my casting preparations.~
@79   = ~And how have you found the experience?~
@80   = ~Remarkably effective, actually. My focus has improved, particularly during the more... unstable aspects of wild magic manipulation.~
@81   = ~I am pleased to hear this. The body and mind are not separate entities, but aspects of the same whole.~
@82   = ~Yes, well, wizards tends to emphasize the intellectual over the physical. A rather significant oversight, it seems.~
@83   = ~Even the greatest scholars can overlook wisdom if they search only within books.~
@84   = ~I shall consider that the next time I'm buried in research. Though I do draw the line at practicing shirtless in the moonlight.~

@85   = ~Your concentration during our last battle was impressive. You maintained control even when surrounded.~
@86   = ~High praise coming from you. I've been implementing those centering exercises we discussed.~
@87   = ~ The path of improvement requires both discipline and willingness to adapt.~
@88   = ~Something my parents understood well. They... died testing the boundaries of wild magic. Too much curiosity, perhaps not enough caution.~
@89   = ~I am sorry for your loss. My brother Gamaz also died seeking truth, though along a darker path.~
@90   = ~I... didn't mean to bring up painful memories. My condolences about your brother.~
@91   = ~Do not apologize. Shared understanding of loss creates bridges between different paths.~
@92   = ~Indeed.~

// Rasaad ToB

@93   = ~The divine essence we encounter in this place... does it affect your connection to Selûne?~
@94   = ~It is strange. The proximity to godhood makes her light both clearer and somehow more distant.~
@95   = ~Fascinating. The wild magic currents here behave similarly—more potent yet harder to grasp. Rather like trying to hold moonlight.~
@96   = ~An apt comparison.~
@97   = ~I've been meaning to ask, after this is finished, will you return to a monastery?~
@98   = ~I do not believe so. My journey has shown me that Selûne's teachings need not be confined to temple walls.~
@99   = ~I understand. I've been considering establishing a proper arcane academy myself somewhere away from Amnian politics. The old Ulcaster ruins have a certain... scholarly resonance that appeals to me.~
@100  = ~Our journeys continue in different directions, yet both seek to share what we've learned. May your academy bring light to those who study the chaotic arts.~
