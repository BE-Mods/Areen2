@1   = ~Areen the wild mage NPC mod for BG2EE~
@2   = ~Areen~
@3   = ~When asked about his past, AREEN straightens his robes meticulously before responding. Born to a disgraced branch of House Selemchant in Athkatla, he was raised amid whispers of scandal after his parents chose to study wild magic rather than conventional spellcraft. Their mysterious disappearance during an arcane experiment left him with half-finished journals and a determination to prove wild magic worthy of scholarly respect.

Though his manner remains formal, there's an unmistakable gleam in his eye when discussing magical theory. For all his reserved demeanor, you suspect AREEN finds more joy in the unpredictable nature of his magic than he's willing to admit, even to himself.~
@4   = ~Areen's Body~
@5   = ~Areen was captured by Bodhi and infected with vampirism, forcing you to slay her. There may be some way to revive her, though you do not know what it would be.~
@6   = ~Areen's Mother~
@7   = ~After the Bhaalspawn saga concluded, Areen Selemchant returned briefly to Athkatla, where his systematic approach to wild magic earned him reluctant recognition from the Cowled Wizards. His theories on controlled chaos magic were eventually compiled into a treatise that found its way to Candlekeep's archives.

The noble houses of Amn, however, proved as stifling as ever. When word reached him of ancient wild magic sites in the Snowflake Mountains, Areen departed his homeland, methodically documenting the chaotic energies he encountered. His research expeditions would occasionally cross paths with his old companions, leading to brief but meaningful reunions.

Years later, Areen undertook the ambitious task of restoring the ruins of Ulcaster School of Magic. Where others saw only crumbling remnants of a tragic past, he recognized an opportunity to honor both magical scholarship and controlled chaos. He established an academy there, where he taught aspiring wild mages - though students would often hear him muttering "fuck fuck fuck" under his breath when experiments went particularly awry. Despite these occasional setbacks, his unique blend of scholarly precision and resigned acceptance of chaos proved remarkably effective.

His parents' crafting journals, once lost to bandits, were eventually recovered from a collector in Waterdeep. They now rest in his academy's library, alongside his own extensive research - a testament to Areen's family's enduring dedication to understanding the controlled chaos of wild magic.~
@8   = ~After the Bhaalspawn saga, Areen and <CHARNAME> found themselves bound by something deeper than adventure - a connection of minds and hearts that transcended the chaos around them. Together, they restored the ruins of Ulcaster School of Magic, turning it into both a sanctuary for their companionship and a beacon for aspiring wild mages.

Their partnership proved as complementary as order and chaos themselves. While Areen meticulously documented magical theories, <CHARNAME> brought adventure and spontaneity to their shared life. Many evenings would find them in the academy's highest tower, sharing tales of their day's discoveries over cups of Amnian tea.

Though they would occasionally part ways - Areen to his research expeditions and <CHARNAME> to answer destiny's call - they always found their way back to each other. Their reunions were marked by quiet joy and shared understanding, often accompanied by Areen's flustered yet endearing "Oh dear, I've missed you terribly."

His parents' recovered journals now rest in their shared library, alongside the volumes of research he and <CHARNAME> compiled together - a testament to how love, like wild magic, needs neither physical expression nor conventional form to work its own special kind of chaos in perfect order.~

@11  = ~Acolyte's Chaos Vestment~
@12  = ~These distinctive robes were first crafted in the years following the Time of Troubles, when practitioners of wild magic sought ways to better control their increasingly unpredictable art. The fabric is interwoven with metallic threads forming intricate patterns that help stabilize magical energies. While not as potent as the legendary Archmaster's Chaos Vestments crafted by the most accomplished wild mages, these robes became popular among early practitioners for their protective properties. Several sets were created in Waterdeep's magical academies as wild magic began to gain acceptance among more traditional spellcasters.

Improved Chaos Shield increases a Wild Mage's chance to gain a favorable result when a Wild Surge occurs. Every time a roll is made on the Wild Surge chart, an extra 25 is added to the dice roll. When Nahal's Reckless Dweomer is cast, the bonus from Improved Chaos Shield stacks with the Wild Mage's level bonus. It does not stack with Chaos Shield.~

@15  = ~A Beginner's Guide to Controlled Chaos~
@16  = ~This foundational text approaches wild magic as a serious field of study requiring disciplined practice and thorough theoretical understanding. The author emphasizes the importance of proper magical theory, careful preparation, and methodical approach to spell manipulation.

Essential Principles for the Aspiring Wild Mage:

Contrary to common belief, most wild surge manifestations are manageable with proper preparation. While dramatic effects do occur, experienced practitioners rarely face truly dangerous consequences.

The wise practitioner maintains basic protective enchantments against fire and movement impediments. A ring of fire resistance is considered essential equipment.

When channeling unstable energies, direct them toward adversaries rather than allies. Many unexpected effects can prove advantageous when properly directed.

Should a surge summon otherworldly entities, maintain distance and protective wards. Such manifestations, while unpredictable, often prove tactically advantageous.

The fundamental protective enchantments developed by early wild magic practitioners remain essential. Advanced versions exist but are not strictly necessary for routine spellcasting.

Maintain valuable items separately from coin wealth. The author particularly emphasizes this after documented instances of mass transmutation.

At higher levels of mastery, practitioners can achieve remarkable effects through controlled manipulation of wild energies, including the casting of complex spells through relatively simple channels.

The text concludes with detailed theoretical frameworks for advanced surge manipulation, though the author notes these techniques require significant magical expertise to attempt safely.~

@17  = ~Cautionary Tales: Notable Wild Magic Accidents in Waterdeep~
@18  = ~This analytical compilation from Waterdeep's Office of Magical Regulation examines significant magical incidents that shaped modern safety protocols. Of particular note is the infamous "Golden Disaster" of 1361 DR, when an unexpected surge transmuted a merchant's entire inventory into various species of waterfowl. While financially ruinous, this incident led to important advances in surge containment theory.

The "Peculiar Case of the Purple Promenade" deserves mention - during a demonstration of controlled wild magic at the Watchful Order, an unexpected surge turned an entire street's worth of citizens temporarily purple. Though harmless, this incident prompted the development of current wild surge protection protocols.

Perhaps most significant was the "Treasury Transmutation" of 1359 DR, where a wild surge accidentally converted a noble's fortune into copper pieces, leading to the current practices of storing valuable items separately from coin. Each case study is accompanied by detailed analysis of preventive measures now standard in magical institutions.~

@19  = ~Wild Magic in a Time of Troubles by Tromed Lov~
@20  = ~The Time of Troubles presented unprecedented opportunities for understanding magical instability. While conventional spellcasters struggled with the Weave's disruption, practitioners of wild magic found their theoretical frameworks uniquely suited to adapt. Their pre-existing research into magical fluctuations provided critical insights into spell stability during this period. The subsequent years saw increased academic interest in wild magic theory, though resistance from traditional magical institutions has slowed its acceptance as a legitimate field of study.~

@21  = ~Theories on Surge Manipulation and Containment~
@22  = ~A detailed examination of wild magic surge patterns and their theoretical foundations. The author presents compelling evidence that proper understanding of magical energy fluctuations can lead to predictable outcomes through careful application of established principles. The treatise includes extensive mathematical formulae for calculating surge probabilities and detailed diagrams of containment methodologies. Essential reading for serious practitioners of wild magic arts.~

@23  = ~Notable Wild Mages of the Sword Coast~
@24  = ~This scholarly work examines the contributions of prominent wild magic practitioners along the Sword Coast. Of particular significance is Randal Mahge, whose methodical approach to wild magic during the Time of Troubles led to breakthrough developments in surge control theory. His treatise 'On Predictable Unpredictability' remains a cornerstone text in magical academies, and his development of stabilizing formulae helped establish wild magic as a legitimate field of study. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Randal's careful documentation and controlled experiments advanced our understanding of wild magic as a distinct magical discipline.

In stark contrast stands the infamous Pryce of Shadowdale, whose erratic experiments and casual approach to wild magic resulted in numerous documented incidents. While his occasional successes led to some interesting discoveries, particularly in the field of magical amplification, his legacy serves more as a cautionary tale of unbridled experimentation. The author notes that Pryce's eventual transformation into a talking sheep (a condition that persisted for three months) exemplifies the risks of treating wild magic without proper academic rigor.

The text includes detailed analysis of experimental procedures and theoretical frameworks that advanced our understanding of wild magic, with particular emphasis on those practitioners who approached the art with scholarly dedication.~

@25  = ~Kruin's Gift~
@26  = ~These finely-crafted gloves bear subtle silvery runes along the fingertips that shimmer with an otherworldly light when wild magic is cast nearby. Crafted by the githyanki wild mage Kruin, these gloves were designed to channel and partially stabilize the chaotic energies of wild magic.

Crafted in the years following the Time of Troubles, it represents the pinnacle of chaos-controlling attire, created by the most accomplished wild mage theorists of that era. The fabric appears to be in constant subtle motion, woven with platinum and mithral threads forming complex mathematical patterns that help channel and stabilize even the most unpredictable magical energies.

Thayze Selemchant gifted these robes as a token of gratitude for his resurrection, having acquired them during his time among the Cowled Wizards of Amn. Such vestments are exceedingly rare, as few practitioners of wild magic ever attain the mastery required to safely craft them.

@10002 = ~While visiting the Graveyard District in Athkatla, Areen asked to visit his family's mausoleum. He seems eager to pay his respects, as he hasn't visited it since childhood.~
@10003 = ~We encountered the ghost of Thayze Selemchant in the family mausoleum. He claims he was betrayed by the current Lord Selemchant, who stole a magical medallion that would have allowed Thayze to be resurrected. He's asked us to recover the medallion from his nephew.~
@10004 = ~Lord Selemchant denied knowing about the medallion's magical properties. He claims he donated it to the Temple of Waukeen years ago as a gesture of goodwill.~
@10005 = ~Brysne at the Temple of Waukeen confirmed they have the Selemchant medallion, but will only trade it for an Amulet of Protection.~
@10006 = ~We exchanged an Amulet of Protection for the Selemchant medallion. Now we must return it to Thayze's ghost.~
@10007 = ~Before returning the medallion to Thayze, we were confronted by a group of Selemchant house guards who demanded we bring the medallion back to Lord Selemchant. This family dispute runs deeper than it first appeared.~
@10008 = ~We returned the medallion to Lord Selemchant. He seemed relieved to have the family heirloom back and rewarded us handsomely. We better avoid the Selemchant's mausoleum for a time.~
@10009 = ~After giving the medallion to Lord Selemchant, we returned to the mausoleum. Thayze's ghost was enraged by our betrayal and attacked us. We were forced to put his spirit to rest permanently.~
@10010 = ~We brought the medallion to Thayze's ghost. The artifact's magic restored him to life after years trapped as a spirit. A grateful Thayze gave us the restored medallion before departing to seek a new life far from Amn. Should we tell Lord Selemchant?~
@10011 = ~After giving the medallion to Thayze, we confronted Lord Selemchant. He was furious that we helped resurrect his uncle and threatened retribution from House Selemchant.~
@10012 = ~Soldiers of House Selemchant ambushed us at the city gates, clearly seeking revenge for our role in Thayze's resurrection. Lord Selemchant has made his point. Pursuing the matter further would only bring unwanted attention to the family's internal conflicts.~

// These are the entries for Bodhi abduction.
@100001 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing from me the one person that is dearest to my heart: Areen. Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible.  I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of the one I love is at stake, as well!~
@100002 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

While I had feared for some time that Bodhi's final revenge on me would be to take away Areen forever, it seems that the information in the lorebook was right... Amaunator's idol has restored Areen not only to life, but has removed the vampiric curse from her, as well.~
